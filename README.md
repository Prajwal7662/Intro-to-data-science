📘 Basic Knowledge of Data Science

Data Science is the field that combines statistics, programming, and domain knowledge to extract meaningful insights from data. It helps organizations make data-driven decisions and build intelligent systems.

🧠 1. What is Data Science?

Data Science involves:

Collecting data

Cleaning and processing data

Analyzing and visualizing patterns

Building Machine Learning models

Deploying models to solve real-world problems

📊 2. Key Steps in a Data Science Project
1. Problem Definition

Understand the business problem and define the goal.
Example: Predict customer churn, forecast sales, classify emails, etc.

2. Data Collection

Gather data from:

CSV files

Databases

APIs

Web scraping

Sensors

3. Data Cleaning

Fix issues like:

Missing values

Duplicate rows

Incorrect data types

Outliers

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Use statistics and visualizations:

Mean, median, distribution

Correlation

Histograms, scatter plots

Heatmaps

5. Feature Engineering

Create useful variables:

Encoding categories

Scaling/normalizing

Creating new columns

Removing irrelevant features

6. Model Building

Train ML models depending on the problem:

Supervised Learning

Regression: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

Classification: Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN

Unsupervised Learning

Clustering: K-Means, DBSCAN

Dimensionality Reduction: PCA

📈 4. Types of Machine Learning
✔ Supervised Learning

Model learns using labeled data.
Examples: Spam detection, fraud detection, price prediction.

✔ Unsupervised Learning

Model finds patterns without labels.
Examples: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection.

✔ Reinforcement Learning

Model learns through rewards/punishments.
Examples: Robotics, game AI.
